DURATION: 8 WEEKS

DESCRIPTION-
1. Introduction
The Task 1 project is a web-based news application designed to fetch and display the latest headlines from an online news API. The core purpose of the application is to integrate a web frontend with an external REST API to deliver real-time news updates directly to the user. This project highlights skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with API handling techniques for dynamic content rendering.

In a time when news consumption is largely digital, the need for up-to-date and accessible news delivery has never been greater. Instead of relying on static content, this application provides live updates, allowing users to see the most recent headlines without having to refresh or navigate away from the page.

2. Objectives
The objectives of this task are:

To build a clean, responsive web interface using HTML and CSS.

To integrate a public news API for fetching live data.

To dynamically generate and display articles based on API responses.

To handle scenarios where the API request fails or returns incomplete data.

To improve user experience by providing clickable links to full articles.

3. Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the web page content.

CSS3 – For styling and enhancing the visual appeal.

JavaScript (ES6+) – For API calls, handling data, and updating the page dynamically.

News API or GNews API – For accessing live, real-time news data.

Fetch API or Axios – For making HTTP requests to the news API.

4. Features
The News App incorporates several key features:

Live News Fetching – It pulls the latest headlines from a chosen country or category.

Dynamic Rendering – News items are displayed immediately after the API call is completed.

Error Handling – The app shows a clear error message if fetching fails.

Responsive Design – The layout adapts to different screen sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile use.

External Links – Each article provides a clickable link to the original source.

5. Workflow
The process begins by setting up the API key from the chosen news provider. The API endpoint is configured to filter news by parameters such as country code (e.g., in for India) or category (e.g., sports, technology).

On the frontend, an HTML structure defines placeholders for news content. CSS styling ensures that headlines, summaries, and links are visually distinct and easy to read.

The JavaScript component is responsible for:

Sending a request to the API endpoint.

Extracting relevant details such as title, description, and article link from the API’s JSON response.

Creating and appending new elements to the webpage for each article.

Managing loading states and handling errors gracefully.

6. Output
When the application loads, it retrieves the most recent headlines for the configured country. Each news item displayed contains:

Headline – The article’s title.

Description – A brief summary of the article.

Link – A clickable hyperlink that opens the full article in a new browser tab.

If the API fails or returns no articles, the application displays an appropriate message to the user instead of leaving the page blank.

7. Error Handling
An important aspect of the project is user-friendly error handling. If there is an internet connection issue, an expired API key, or a problem on the API server, the user is informed with a clear message rather than generic browser errors. This ensures a smoother experience and reduces confusion.

8. Conclusion
This News App project demonstrates essential frontend development skills such as working with APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript operations, and dynamically updating the DOM. The app provides a foundation for more advanced features like search filters, pagination, sorting by category, or integrating multiple APIs.

It also reflects the real-world requirement for web applications to deliver live, accurate, and visually appealing content efficiently. Through this project, key concepts like asynchronous programming, error handling, and user-centric design have been successfully implemented.
